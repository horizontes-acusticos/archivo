## üîë Key Concepts

### Audio Selection System
The application uses a unique **ID-based selection system** that ensures:
- Only one track appears selected across all tabs
- Audio continues playing when switching tabs
- Simple, bulletproof cross-tab logic

### Global Playlist Strategy
All tracks from all seasons are loaded into a single global playlist, enabling:
- Seamless navigation between seasons
- Efficient next/previous functionality
- Unified state management

### Component Architecture
Clean separation of concerns with:
- **AudioContext**: Global state management
- **AudioDataTable**: Track display and selection
- **HowlerAudioPlayer**: Audio playback controls
- **useCsvAudioData**: Data fetching and processing

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/ui
- **Audio**: Howler.js
- **Data Processing**: Papa Parse (CSV)
- **State Management**: React Context
- **Deployment**: Vercel (recommended)

## üìä Project Statistics

- **Components**: 5 main components
- **Hooks**: 1 custom hook
- **Context Providers**: 1 audio context
- **CSV Data Sources**: 4 seasonal files
- **Supported Devices**: Desktop, tablet, mobile
- **Browser Support**: Modern browsers (90%+ support)

## üéµ Audio Features

- **Continuous Playback**: Audio never stops when switching tabs
- **Global Navigation**: Next/Previous works across all seasons
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of currently playing track
- **Mobile Support**: Touch gestures and responsive controls
- **Format Support**: MP3, WAV, and other Howler.js supported formats

## üì± Responsive Design

The application is fully responsive with:
- **Desktop**: Full-featured interface with mouse interactions
- **Tablet**: Optimized layouts for touch interactions  
- **Mobile**: Compact layouts with gesture support
